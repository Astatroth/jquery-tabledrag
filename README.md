jQuery (Drupal) Tablesort plugin
================================

This is a fork of the [Drupal](http://www.drupal.org/project/drupal) Tablesort Javascrtip component. It allows you to make tables sortable by drag and drop.

The plugin gracefully degrades when JS is not available by showing one or two select lists, allowing users to select a "weight" for each row (defining the *order*) as well as optionally a "parent" (defining a *hierarchy*).

It is based on the Drupal 7 version.


Use case
--------

This component is used throughout the Drupal backend, but most noticeably in the menu administration. It allows users to easily reorder and reorganize their site's menu items with a drag-n-drop interface.

It's designed to be used with forms. Order and hierarchy information are stored in form inputs (select lists, textfields or hidden inputs). This allows developpers to create an intuitive front-end interface, while still being able to use classic forms for sending data to the back-end. No AJAX is required.
