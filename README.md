jQuery (Drupal) Tablesort plugin
================================

This is a fork of the [Drupal](http://www.drupal.org/project/drupal) Tablesort component. It allows you to make tables sortable by drag and drop.
The plugin gracefully degrades when JS is not available by showing one or two select lists, allowing users to select a "weight" for each row (defining the *order*) as well as optionally a "parent" (defining a *hierarchy*).
